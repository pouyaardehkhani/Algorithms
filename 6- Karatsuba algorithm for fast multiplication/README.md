# Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm
It is a replacement for the grade school algorithm for multiplying numbers. of bigger digits. The Karatsuba Algorithm for fast multiplication algorithm using Divide and Conquer developed by Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba in 1960.

**O(n^log2(3)) time (~ O(n^1.585))**

Where n is the number of digits of the numbers multiplying. It is discussed by multiplying two big integer numbers to show internal working step by step. The goal is to reduce the space complexity for which the integer numbers terms will be broken down in such a way to x and y are broken into a set of digits as the logic behind it is divide and conquer. If the numbers are smaller there is no need to multiply, standard mutilation of two integers is preferred.
