# Padovan Sequence
Padovan Sequence similar to Fibonacci sequence with similar recursive structure. The recursive formula is, 

```
  P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
  P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1 
```

Padovan Sequence: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37,â€¦.. 

Spiral of equilateral triangles with side lengths which follow the Padovan sequence.
