# AKS Primality Test (Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality test)
it is deterministically correct for any general number.

### Features of AKS primality test : 
1. The AKS algorithm can be used to verify the primality of any general number given. 
2. The maximum running time of the algorithm can be expressed as a polynomial over the number of digits in the target number. 
3. The algorithm is guaranteed to distinguish deterministically whether the target number is prime or composite. 
4. The correctness of AKS is not conditional on any subsidiary unproven hypothesis.

The algorithm is based on the condition that if n is any number, then it is prime if, (x – 1)^n – (x^n – 1) is divisible by n.
