# Euclid Euler Theorem
According to Euclid Euler Theorem, a perfect number which is even, can be represented in the form ((2^n - 1)*(2^n / 2)) where n is a prime number and 2^(n)-1 is a Mersenne prime number. It is a product of a power of 2 with a Mersenne prime number. This theorem establishes a connection between a Mersenne prime and an even perfect number.
