# Catalan Number
Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers.

The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, … 

### Pseudocode: 
```
a) initially set cat_=1 and print it
b) run a for loop i=1 to i<=n
            cat_ *= (4*i-2)
            cat_ /= (i+1)
            print cat_
c) end loop and exit     
```

**Time Complexity: O(n)**
