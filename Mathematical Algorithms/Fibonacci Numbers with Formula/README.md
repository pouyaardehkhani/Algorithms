# Fibonacci numbers
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

we directly implement the formula for nth term in the fibonacci series. 

```
Fn = {[(√5 + 1)/2] ^ n} / √5 
```

**Time Complexity: O(logn), this is because calculating phi^n takes logn time**

**Space Complexity: O(1)**
