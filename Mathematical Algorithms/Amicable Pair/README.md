# Amicable Pair
Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. 

The logic is very simple. We compare sum of the proper divisors of both numbers and compare sum for one number with other number.
