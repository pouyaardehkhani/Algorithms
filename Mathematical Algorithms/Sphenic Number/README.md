# Sphenic Number
A Sphenic Number is a positive integer n which is product of exactly three distinct primes. The first few sphenic numbers are 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, â€¦ 

Sphenic number can be checked by fact that every sphenic number will have exactly 8 divisor SPHENIC NUMBER 

So first We will try to find if the number is having exactly 8 divisors if not then simply answer is no.If there are exactly 8 divisors then we will confirm weather the first 3 digits after 1 are prime or not. Eg. 30 (sphenic number) 
30=p*q*r(i.e p,q and r are three distinct prime no and their product are 30) 
the set of divisor is (1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30).
