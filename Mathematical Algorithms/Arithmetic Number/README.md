# Arithmetic Number
In number theory, an arithmetic number is an integer for which the average of its positive divisors is also an integer. Or in other words, a number N is arithmetic if the number of divisors divides the sum of divisors. 

### Algorithm:
1. Find sum of all the factors of a number , say sum.
2. Find count of divisors (say Count).
3. Check if sum is divisible by count.
