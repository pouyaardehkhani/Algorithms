# N-bonacci Numbers
You are given two integers N and M, and print all the terms of the series up to M-terms of the N-bonacci Numbers.

```
In general, in N-bonacci sequence, we use sum of preceding N numbers from the next term. For example, a 3-bonacci sequence is the following: 
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with one or zero, followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number is equal to the sum of preceding two numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8â€¦..
