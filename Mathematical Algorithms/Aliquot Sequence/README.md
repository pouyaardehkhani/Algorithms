# Aliquot Sequence
Given a number n, the task is to print its Aliquot Sequence. Aliquot Sequence of a number starts with itself, remaining terms of the sequence are sum of proper divisors of immediate previous term. For example, Aliquot Sequence for 10 is 10, 8, 7, 1, 0. The sequence may repeat. For example, for 6, we have an infinite sequence of all 6s. In such cases we print the repeating number and stop.

### Important Points:
* Numbers which have repeating Aliquot sequence of length 1 are called Perfect Numbers.
* Numbers which have repeating Aliquot sequence of length 2 are called Amicable numbers.
* Numbers which have repeating Aliquot sequence of length 3 are called sociable number.
* It is conjectured that every aliquot sequence ends in one of the following ways
		* with a prime number which in turn ends with 1 and then 0.
		* a perfect number
		* a set of amicable or sociable numbers.
