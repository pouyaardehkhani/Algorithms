# Power Set
Power set P(S) of a set S is the set of all subsets of S. For example S = {a, b, c} then P(s) = {{}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.
If S has n elements in it then P(s) will have 2^n elements

### Algorithm: 
```
Input: Set[], set_size
1. Get the size of power set
    powet_set_size = pow(2, set_size)
2  Loop for counter from 0 to pow_set_size
     (a) Loop for i = 0 to set_size
          (i) If ith bit in counter is set
               Print ith element from set for this subset
     (b) Print separator for subsets i.e., newline
```
